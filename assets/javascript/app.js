$(document).ready(function () {
//create a click function for every character
//have the character clicked upon move to the your character section
//then on the second click, have the second character go to the defender section
//when click attack button, substract HP lost from both your character and defender
//create a random number when attacking
//Each character has 3 attributes, health points, attack power, and counter attack power
//Each time your character attacks, their attack power increases by base attack power
//example, if base attack is 6, each attack will increase by 6 (12,18,24 and so on)
//The enemy character only has a counter attack, which never changes.
//The health points , attack power, and counter attack power must be different for each character
